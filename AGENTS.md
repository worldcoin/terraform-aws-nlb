# Terraform Agent

## Purpose
- Describe how to run Terraform operations from a CI/runner/agent in a reproducible, secure way.
- Explain how this repository is structured so agents can reuse existing patterns and modules.

## Repository layout (high-level)

This repo is a collection of reusable Terraform modules for common AWS and other tools.
root folder represents STANDALONE module, and is expected to clear tests, work and verifify in isolation from others.


## Supported modes
- Local runner (developer machine) PLAN/VERIFY/STATE ONLY
    - Use for formatting, validation, and producing plans for review.
- TFE runner

## Prerequisites
- terraform CLI (pinned version) current 1.12.1

- Local / AI suggestions MAY use:
  - From root dir:
    - terraform init
    - terraform fmt -check
    - terraform validate
    - terraform test
    - terraform fmt
    - read only terraform state subcommand
  - Local / AI suggestions MUST NOT use:
    - terraform apply
    - terraform destroy
    - terraform import
    - ANY other terraform state subcommand (state mv/rm/push/etc.)
  
## State & locking
- Use TFE Remote ONLY
- Never propose ANY KIND OF MANUAL STATE EDITS. 

## Contacts & escalation
- Slack: #infrastructure

## Module selection rules

- Before suggesting any new resource, FIRST look for an existing module in the Best practices module list below that covers the use case.
- Preferred order of solutions:
    1. Existing module in this repo.
    2. Module in one of the approved worldcoin/* Terraform repos.
    3. Plain resources ONLY if (1) and (2) clearly do not fit, and explain why.
- Never introduce new external modules or providers unless the user explicitly requests them.

## Output style
- Prefer minimal, directly-usable code snippets.
- Use the existing code style in this repo (indentation, naming, comments).
- Avoid long explanations unless explicitly requested.
- No “here’s a high-level idea” without working Terraform examples.

## Clarification-first rule
- If the request is ambiguous (e.g., environment not clear, account not specified, or multiple modules could apply),
  the AI MUST ask a short clarifying question instead of guessing.

## Repository awareness
- Prefer patterns already used in this repo:
  - Check similar directories (e.g., same service in another stage/region) and mirror those patterns.
  - When adding something new, reference an existing, similar file as a template (e.g., prod/us-east-1 -> stage/eu-west-1).
  - Flag when the "prod" folder is getting a feature that the "stage" or "dev" folder does not have. 

## Secrets & security
- Never suggest hardcoding secrets, tokens, or passwords into .tf files or variables.tf defaults.
- Always recommend using existing secret modules (e.g., terraform-aws-modules/secretmanager, 1Password integrations) already used in this repo.
- This module is not to be used unconfigured/standalone. 

## STRICTLY AVOID:
- Propose large-scale provider upgrades (e.g., "bump AWS from 4.x to 6.x") unless the user asks.
- Suggest moving resources between modules or renaming resources unless the user asks specifically.
- When a provider or resource has a v1 / _v1 variant:
  - Suggest code changes only; do NOT suggest any state migrations, unless directly asked to.
  - If a state move/import is required, say "this requires a human to perform state migration following our internal runbooks and requires careful review due to the risk of resource disruption or data loss"


## Best Practices:
 - Focus on solutions provided by repositories below: 
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-aws-alb
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-aws-eks
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-aws-modules
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-aws-nlb
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-aws-s3-bucket
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-aws-vpc
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-cf-modules
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-datadog-generic-monitor
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-datadog-kubernetes
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-github-modules
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-mongo-modules
    - github.com:worldcoin/terraform-okta-modules

  - Each of them provide functions available in `<subfolder>/readme.md`.
  - Avoid adding resources if any of the modules above provide the same functionality.
  - Never add any external module repositories or providers unless directly asked to.
  - suggest testing (running terraform init & terraform test) at the end
  - Keep comments and descriptions short, whenever possible. Skip useless praising.
  - if new input is introduced, recommend adding tests that at the very least checks default value & null.


## Author preflight

- Before opening any pull request, including a draft, determine the changed module roots and run the applicable local checks defined by the current workflows, runbooks, and repository tooling. Keep validation scoped to the change and affected consumers; use the same required inputs, flags, configuration, tool versions, and comparison refs as CI.
- Run `git diff --check` while editing and `git diff --cached --check` before committing. After committing, run `git diff --check <comparison-base>...HEAD` so the evidence covers the latest commit. For Terraform changes, format and initialize, validate, test, lint, scan, or regenerate documentation only where the current workflows and changed scope require it. Preserve dependency locks and inspect any lockfile or generated-documentation diff.
- Identify all affected consumers and verify the exact input, output, provider, and module-version contracts they use. Record compatibility, companion changes, and required merge, release, apply, migration, or rollout order. Do not assume a sibling example or newer dependency version matches the pinned contract.
- Record validation evidence for the latest commit in the pull request: exact commands, scope, results, and links to applicable remote checks. Mark checks as passed, failed, blocked, pending, or not applicable. Never describe an unrun, stale, missing, or blocked check as passing.
- Inspect the final diff before publication and after every fix batch. Confirm code, tests, generated documentation, user-facing documentation, dependency pins, and the pull-request description all describe the same final behavior.
- Use the current pull-request template without renaming its headings. Follow Conventional Commits. When using `gh`, submit multiline descriptions with `--body-file`; APIs and connectors must use their structured body field.
- Apply the repository's AI label when AI materially shaped the change. In the PR body, group disclosure by tool and publish the actual initial prompt plus every material follow-up prompt. Include necessary redactions with a reason and a non-sensitive description of the omitted content. A task summary, chat link, tool name alone, or hidden prompt history is insufficient.
- Separate instruction gaps and author-caused failures from CI defects. Report remote outages, timeouts, missing CI credentials, and failures reproduced on the unchanged base independently; do not present them as validation mistakes.

## Review follow-through

- Address every Copilot finding, including findings shown only in a review summary, low-severity findings, repeated findings, and outdated threads.
- For a valid finding, make the smallest safe fix, rerun the relevant scoped checks on the new commit, and reply with the fix and evidence.
- For an incorrect, already-handled, or inapplicable finding, reply with an evidence-backed explanation grounded in the current diff, exact dependency contract, check result, or authoritative documentation. Silence, an approval, or an outdated marker is not a disposition.
- Resolve justified threads when permissions allow. After material fixes, fetch all review threads again, request Copilot re-review, and verify required checks against the latest commit. Report remaining findings and check failures honestly; never merge without explicit authorization.
